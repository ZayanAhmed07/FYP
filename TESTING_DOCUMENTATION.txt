## 8. TESTING AND EVALUATION

Once the system has been successfully developed, testing has to be performed to ensure that the system is working as intended. This is also to check that the system meets the requirements stated earlier. Besides that, system testing will help in finding the errors that may be hidden from the user. The testing must be completed before it is deployed for use.

There are four types of testing performed: Unit Testing, Functional Testing, Business Rules Testing, and Integration Testing. Each has been performed in-depth to ensure system quality.

## 8.1 UNIT TESTING

Unit Testing is a level of software testing where individual units of a software/component are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software.

## 8.3 BUSINESS RULES TESTING

Decision table based testing technique is used to test business rules. The business rules were defined in Functional Requirements and Use Cases. Decision-based testing uses a systematic approach where inputs and outputs are provided in tabular form. It is a precise and compact way to model complicated logic.

### Business Rule 1: Proposal Acceptance and Order Creation

**Business Rule**: When a client (buyer) accepts a consultant's proposal, an order must be created, the proposal status changes to "accepted", all other proposals for the same job are rejected, the job status changes to "in_progress", and both parties are notified.

**Decision Table**:

| Condition | Test 1 | Test 2 | Test 3 | Test 4 | Test 5 |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Proposal exists | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| Proposal status is "pending" | Yes | No | Yes | N/A | Yes |
| User is job owner (buyer) | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |
| Job is still active | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Actions** | | | | | |
| Create order | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Update proposal to "accepted" | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Reject other proposals | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Update job to "in_progress" | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Send notifications | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Return error | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

| Test No. | Test Case | Input Values | Expected Result | Actual Result | Result |
|----------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| BR-001 | Accept valid pending proposal as job owner with active job | proposalId: valid<br>status: "pending"<br>userId: job owner<br>jobStatus: "active" | Order created, proposal accepted, other proposals rejected, job in_progress, notifications sent | All conditions met, order created successfully | Pass |
| BR-002 | Attempt to accept already accepted proposal | proposalId: valid<br>status: "accepted" | Error 400: "Proposal already accepted" | Error returned as expected | Pass |
| BR-003 | Attempt to accept proposal by non-job-owner | proposalId: valid<br>userId: not job owner | Error 403: "Forbidden - not authorized" | Authorization check working | Pass |
| BR-004 | Attempt to accept non-existent proposal | proposalId: invalid | Error 404: "Proposal not found" | Error returned correctly | Pass |
| BR-005 | Attempt to accept proposal for inactive job | proposalId: valid<br>jobStatus: "cancelled" | Error 400: "Job is no longer active" | Job status validation working | Pass |

### Business Rule 2: Payment Release Conditions

**Business Rule**: Payment can only be released to consultant if: order status is "completed", completion has been confirmed by client (buyer), and amount to release doesn't exceed amountPending.

**Decision Table**:

| Condition | Test 1 | Test 2 | Test 3 | Test 4 |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Order status is "completed" | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |
| Buyer confirmed completion | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| Amount ≤ amountPending | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| User is buyer (order owner) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Actions** | | | | |
| Release payment | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Update amountPaid | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Update amountPending | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Notify consultant | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Return error | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

| Test No. | Test Case | Input Values | Expected Result | Actual Result | Result |
|----------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| BR-006 | Release payment for completed order with valid amount | orderId: valid<br>status: "completed"<br>amount: 5000<br>amountPending: 5000 | Payment released, amountPaid updated, amountPending reduced, consultant notified | Payment processed successfully | Pass |
| BR-007 | Attempt to release payment for in_progress order | orderId: valid<br>status: "in_progress"<br>amount: 5000 | Error 400: "Order not completed" | Error returned as expected | Pass |
| BR-008 | Attempt to release payment before buyer confirms | orderId: valid<br>status: "pending_completion" | Error 400: "Completion not confirmed" | Validation working | Pass |
| BR-009 | Attempt to release amount exceeding pending | orderId: valid<br>amount: 10000<br>amountPending: 5000 | Error 400: "Amount exceeds pending balance" | Amount validation working | Pass |

### Business Rule 3: Duplicate Proposal Prevention

**Business Rule**: A consultant can only submit one proposal per job. Attempting to submit a duplicate proposal for the same job should be rejected.

| Test No. | Test Case | Input Values | Expected Result | Actual Result | Result |
|----------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|--------|

| BR-012 | Submit proposal for different job | jobId: job-789 (different job)<br>consultantId: consultant-456 | Proposal created successfully | Multiple proposals allowed for different jobs | Pass |

### Business Rule 4: User Role-Based Access Control

**Business Rule**: Certain actions are restricted based on user account type (buyer, consultant, admin).

| Test No. | Test Case | Input Values | Expected Result | Actual Result | Result |
|----------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| BR-013 | Client attempts to create consultant profile | accountType: "buyer"<br>action: POST /api/consultants | Error 403: "Only consultants can create profiles" | Access denied correctly | Pass |

   - Complete chatbot-order integration

3. **Low Priority Features**:
   - Implement admin user suspension feature (FT-052)

4. **Testing Coverage Improvements**:
   - Add more unit tests for Messaging module
   - Increase integration testing for Reviews module
   - Add comprehensive tests for Admin module

5. **Performance Testing**: Consider adding performance tests for:
   - Concurrent proposal submissions

### Conclusion

The testing phase has revealed that the Expert Raah platform has achieved a **91.11% pass rate** across 90 comprehensive test cases. The system demonstrates strong functionality in core modules (Authentication, Jobs, Proposals, Orders) with minor issues identified in authorization checks and admin features. 

The 8 failed test cases represent edge cases and incomplete features that do not impact the core user experience. With the recommended fixes implemented, the platform is expected to achieve 98%+ test pass rate and is suitable for deployment to a staging environment for user acceptance testing.

**Testing Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - Ready for User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

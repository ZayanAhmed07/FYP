                    CHAPTER 8: TESTING AND EVALUATION
                         Expert Raah Platform
================================================================================

Once the system has been successfully developed, testing has to be performed to 
ensure that the system is working as intended. This is also to check that the 
system meets the requirements stated earlier. Besides that, system testing will 
help in finding the errors that may be hidden from the user. The testing must be 
completed before it is deployed for use.

There are few types of testing which includes the unit testing, functional 
testing, business rules testing, and integration testing. Each of these has been 
performed in-depth to ensure system quality.

================================================================================
8.1 UNIT TESTING

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units of a 
software/component are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of 
the software performs as designed.
